I recently had to upgrade the throughput on that data-channel and I want to record here how that happened.</p><p>I scheduled my first AWS Exam for a Friday and had been doing the in-course questions and passing at about 80%. Then, on the Wednesday morning before the scheduled exam I took the BenchPrep official practice exam. I scored <strong>30%</strong>. There was a significant elevation of urgency.</p><p>My first signal optimization was to filter out the noise. Over the next several hours I blocked out all thinking about anything else, as much as that&rsquo;s possible. I was able to eliminate all social media and as much interpersonal communications as possible and isolate my brain to a dedicated task, flushing the cache on almost all other concerns and clearing my plate.</p><p>Within those two and a half days I was able to turn my 30% score on the practice exam, which is significantly easier than the full exam, into an 82% on the official exam.</p><p>I started making notes about the specific steps I used to make that semi-miraculous but technically acheivable turn-around so I could use them again, and then I decided that the best way to validate which ones worked best was to <em>test</em> them again by taking the next AWS Exam. I didn&rsquo;t want to panic-cram again for the next exams. I wanted use what I learned from the panic-cram to create a smoother and less disruptive learning pipeline.</p><p>Over the next few months I developed my learning process into what I call the &ldquo;test->learn REPL&rdquo; and passed an additional 5 AWS Certified Exams:</p><p><img src=certs-row.png alt="My six certifications, so far"></p><p>I learned some strong lessons about laser-focused learning, known as &ldquo;deliberate practice&rdquo;, which I want to record for myself and which I want to share with you in this post.</p><p>NOTE: The first thing I did was to notify everyone I needed to that I would not be responding until after 6 PM Friday. You have to have your mind as clear as possible, and you can&rsquo;t do that if you have something hanging over it. AWS allows rescheduling.</p><h2 id=the-test-learn-repl>The Test->Learn REPL</h2><p>Rapid learning is like a superpower. Learning a new technology fast means all the subsequent work you do in that technology will be much more productive.</p><p>This is why testing is closely related to the whole field of technology. Technological improvements are characterized by one significant feature: They can be tested.</p><p>Testing is the fastest way to validate your thinking.</p><p>Whenever we want to know if a person understands a topic we start asking them questions about it. Those are little tests. It doesn&rsquo;t prove they know the whole subject, so if we need higher levels of expertise, we continue to ask questions or we observe them working under real-world simulating test conditions.</p><p>This is the same process involved in learning by &ldquo;experience&rdquo;. Experience has a very broad definition, but in the context of learning it simply means you have been <em>tested</em> with active business challenges.</p><p>The AWS Certified exams are an attempt to approximate a specific set of active business challenges in order to validate a candidate&rsquo;s pertinent knowledge set.</p><p>AWS Provides these stats regarding AWS Exam Certs:</p><p><img src=2022-08-26-13-04-18.png alt="91% say certs increase innovation"></p><p>In the same way that the AWS Certified exam is just an approximation of the real-world business challenges a developer may face, the Practice Exams available on Udemy, BenchPrep, and the AWS official practice questions are an approximation of the test questions on the AWS Certified Exam.</p><h2 id=the-self-testing-process>The self-testing process</h2><p>Try the free tests first. AWS provides practice exam questions for each official exam along with an Exam Guide here: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/exams/?nc2=sb_ce_exm">Browse Exams</a></p><p>There are other free exams online and very cheap ones in the Android Play Store but those are mostly a waste of time.</p><p>The best practice exams I&rsquo;ve found are the paid exams on Udemy. They&rsquo;re mostly around $12, but up to $100 off-sale. Get a highly rated one and you should get a fair approximation of the official exam content domain.</p><p>The Udemy exams allow you to take them as often as you want. That means you can you can stop if you get 2 out of the first 3 wrong.</p><p>(I am not a salesperson for Udemy. If you know of any other good practice exams please create a PR for this article.)</p><p>It also means you can start testing <em>before</em> you start learning. I did this for a couple of exams so that I could get a baseline on the knowledge set.</p><ul><li>Stop taking example questions if your pass rate is less than 60%.</li><li>Avoid &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; the question by thinking &ldquo;AWS always favors their newest product&rdquo;. They&rsquo;ve done a decent job of avoiding undue product bias in their answers.</li><li>You&rsquo;ll be able to use your failed questions to narrow down the target to study your weak areas.</li><li>Exam review has <em>lots</em> of information about the question!</li></ul><p>The Udemy practice exam review provides significant context for the exam question. This is the <em>most important part</em> of the Testing->Learning REPL.</p><p>Budget a few hours after each practice exam to review, drill down in the links, and understand the context of each question you failed. For verbiage-based topics you can have the browser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Read Aloud&rdquo; function read long content to you.</p><p>Udemy practice exams are typically 4 exams of 65 questions so that each exam mimics the AWS Exam. They are timed based on the AWS Exam you are practicing for.</p><p>That means you can take one exam and study the answers for a few days, and then take another practice exam with another set of questions, so you don&rsquo;t memorize the answer pattern. The questions are also rotated between exam attempts.</p><h2 id=hazards-of-testing-learning>Hazards of Testing->Learning</h2><p>You will have to monitor your thinking while you&rsquo;re testing to make sure you&rsquo;re not doing any of this:</p><ul><li>You are ripping yourself off every time you answer a question by pattern:<ul><li>If you say &ldquo;I remember that the question that started this way should have the answer that started that way&rdquo;, then you are robbing yourself of a valuable learning opportunity.</li><li>Always only ever answer the question after you understand the full context of the question.</li></ul></li><li><em>Never guess</em> on the practice exams. You win <em>nothing</em> by guessing the right answer on a practice exam. You actually short-changing yourself and causing yourself to lose one valuable practice exam question every time you guess.</li><li>If you&rsquo;re not sure of the answer you can flag the question. You then will have to be sure to review your flagged questions when you&rsquo;re doing your review process.</li></ul><p>You can guess on the official exam and you&rsquo;ll lose nothing there because you can&rsquo;t get a list of your failed questions and review them on the official exam.</p><h2 id=resources>Resources</h2><p>Testing is not the source of the information you are tested on.</p><p>The practice exams provide answers about the questions you are tested that you can view <em>after</em> you answer the question, and those answers have content and links to other information resources.</p><p>Organized informational content can be much more effective and helpful than simply Googling each question or browsing YouTube videos.</p><p>Here are some of he resources I found most useful and referred to most often:</p><h3 id=free>Free</h3><ul><li><a href=https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/>AWS Support – Knowledge Center</a><ul><li>Here are some of the most frequent questions and requests that AWS receive from their customers.

That&rsquo;s one reason to store your notes in a local folder git repo. You can expand each of the zips into folders for each course.</li><li>The presentation slides and cheat-sheets are much denser exam-oriented facts than what you&rsquo;ll find in AWS Docs or online.</li><li>Stephane Maarek<ul><li>Maarek provides the densest, most extensive course material and practice exams. There are very slight narration annoyances that might reduce the multi-listen quality. I have almost most of his courses because they are the fullest single-source, if you want to do just one per Exam.</li></ul></li><li>Neil Davis, DataCloud<ul><li>Neil Davis&rsquo;s courses are also very good and the narration is a little clearer, for the listening phase of your study. His practice exams might be slightly weaker.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Cantrill.io<ul><li>Cantrill&rsquo;s courses are the most comprehensive, long range course material.</li><li>He publishes his code and content in actual GitHub repos, so it&rsquo;s much easier to checkout, organize and get updates. You can also create your own upstream remote repo to push any changes or updates you might make.</li><li>His videos have the best explanations, which is useful for the listening-phase of your study schedule.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=thinking-in-tests-is-thinking-in-_bets_>Thinking in tests is thinking in <em>bets</em></h2><ul><li>Templates have checklists and checklists have checkmarks</li><li>Rubber ducky programming is testing your exposition</li></ul><h2 id=your-note-taking-system>Your Note-taking System</h2><p>I would advise creating a folder for all your AWS notes and using a folder-aware text editor like VS Code or Vim to become very comfortable with storing all your content.</p><p>You can create a separate folder for each AWS Exam you&rsquo;re pursuing and put all AWS Exam Guide and Practice Exam pdfs in that folder.</p><p>You can put a note file like <code>_index.md</code> for general notes for that folder in every folder and subfolder. That file will sort to the top.</p><p>Then you can create a git repo for that folder and push it to a host like GitHub which will render your markdown notes in a webpage, complete with image links.</p><footer class=footline></footer></div></div><div id=navigation></div></section><div style=left:-1000px;overflow:scroll;position:absolute;top:-1000px;border:none;box-sizing:content-box;height:200px;margin:0;padding:0;width:200px><div style=border:none;box-sizing:content-box;height:200px;margin:0;padding:0;width:200px></div></div><script src=/js/clipboard.min.js?1661791201></script>
