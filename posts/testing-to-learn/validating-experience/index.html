Good morning Mark - my name is Dimitri, and i am with the Cloud & IT infrastructure team! Congrats of your recent AWS certification, and i would like to ask you if you have any resource to recommend as practice tests? i am planning to take the solutions architect in the near future!</p><p>[8/18 8:28 AM] Mark Stouffer
I was taking the exams in order to learn AWS. I was using a kind of test-to-learn process, so that turned out to mean that testing turned out to be one of the biggest tools I used to prepare for the exams, too. I found a few free or very cheap practice tests, but the best ones I found are about $13-$20 on Udemy, when they have a sale every few weeks. Sometimes they pop up to $60-$100, but WestMonroe reimburses for them anyway.
like 1</p><p>Search for exams for the test you&rsquo;re going to take with either of these guys:</p><p>SO you definetely want to take as many practice exams you can fit in. They take two to three hours, and then you have to review all the answers you didn&rsquo;t KNOW, not just guessed right, but KNOW, so that is a time cost you have to calculate into your considerations, but it was the most dense learning, for me.</p><p>[8/18 8:39 AM] Mark Stouffer
All those authors and other also have good training courses too, and you will probably want one of those also, to connect the dots and provide better context. They have walk-through labs that you can follow along and some code, and important PDF slides. The slides have condensed graphics on each of the topics which are very helpful. Neal Davis has sets of cheat sheets for each topic.</p><p>[8/18 8:42 AM] Mark Stouffer
You want to review the subject matter that you get wrong on the exams before you retake any practice exam. You want to be sure you&rsquo;re not just memorizing ANY questions. You kind of have to self-monitor that, because it will weaken you when the real exam is slightly different and you&rsquo;ve only memorized the words or terms or names. Sometimes the exam will describe the process instead of using the name of the solution.</p><p>[8/18 8:49 AM] Mark Stouffer
The most comprehensive background material with the best videos and course material, if you have a little more time to study is the courses at <a href=https://cantrill.io/>https://cantrill.io/</a>. I went back and got the &ldquo;learn everything&rdquo; course there. He has multiple repos and code labs and stuff and his explanations are the easiest to understand and deepest. He doesn&rsquo;t have a mobile app, so you have to listen in the browser on your phone if you&rsquo;re at that point.</p><p>Stephane Maarek, above, can be a little hard to understand sometimes because he speaks very fast and is a little sloppy with actually pronouncing the words he&rsquo;s saying. It&rsquo;s not a problem you can&rsquo;t understand, but when listening a lot it can be distracting. Cantrill is SUPER clear.

Woolie thinking is a fuzzy collection of early-stage ideas, thoughts and posts covering IT training, Emerging Technology and anything else i find interesting.</p><p>[8/18 8:54 AM] Mark Stouffer
The Udemy exams are a little tough to review because when you follow a link and then return it doesn&rsquo;t take you back to the question or the test it. It takes you back to the course. That makes it so you don&rsquo;t want to follow a link to the source material. I just make a scraper yesterday so that I can copy the results of the test into a local HTML doc in a private repo and convert it into a Markdown doc with collapsible sections for the answers. Then you can view it on Github as a web page with collapsible sections and follow links in the browser, instead of the Udemy app which can be very annoying.

I think you might even be able to see these cheat sheets without a login: <a href=https://digitalcloud.training/category/aws-cheat-sheets/aws-security-identity-compliance/>https://digitalcloud.training/category/aws-cheat-sheets/aws-security-identity-compliance/</a>
