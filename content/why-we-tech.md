description: The moral case for technology

Prometheus is tortured for bringing fire, pyrotechnics, down from heaven. 

Icarus is punished for inventing human flight.

Adam and Eve are "cast out" from the Garden of Eden and convicted with "original sin" for all generations to come, for the crime of tasting of the tree of knowledge.

There is a deep schism between the intellectuals of morality and the intellectuals of technology.
