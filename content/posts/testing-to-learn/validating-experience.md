## Validating Experience

If you've used AWS services for any length of time, you have some knowledge about them but you don't know exactly how your knowledge set relates to other people.

To align our understanding of the AWS set of services and systems we can start by looking at what the exam guide lists as knowledge domains for, as an example, the Certified Developer Associate Exam (DVA-C01):

1. Domain 1 **Deployment** 22%
    1. Deploy written code in AWS using existing CI/CD pipelines, processes, and patterns
    2. Deploy applications using Elastic Beanstalk
    3. Prepare the application deployment package to be deployed to AWS
    4. Deploy serverless applications
2. Domain 2: **Security** 26%
    1. Make authenticated calls to AWS services
    2. Implement encryption using AWS services
    3. Implement application authentication, and authorization
3. Domain 3: **Development with AWS Services** 30%
    1. Write code for serverless applications
    2. Translate functional requirements into application design
    3. Implement application design into application code
    4. Write code that interacts with AWS services by using APIs, SDKs, and AWS CLI
4. Domain 4: **Refactoring** 10%
    1. Optimize application to best use AWS services and features
    2. Migrate existing application code to run on AWS
5. Domain 5: **Monitoring and Troubleshooting** 12%
    1. Write code that can be monitored
    2. Perform root cause analysis on faults found in testing or production
    
The percentages are an attempt to _quantify_ the valid knowlege set for a Developer Associate, but they only tell us the portion of the total knowledge set a prospective Developer Associat needs for Deployment. Those numbers tell us nothing about the quantity of data elements.

Exams can give us a much better idea of the _quantity_ of data elements that a person needs to know to understand **Deployment** at the Developer Associate level.
