## Validating Experience

If you've used AWS services for any length of time, you have some knowledge about them but you don't know exactly how your knowledge set relates to other people.

To align our understanding of the AWS set of services and systems we can start by looking at what the exam guide lists as knowledge domains for, as an example, the Certified Developer Associate Exam (DVA-C01):

1. Domain 1 **Deployment** 22%
    1. Deploy written code in AWS using existing CI/CD pipelines, processes, and patterns
    2. Deploy applications using Elastic Beanstalk
    3. Prepare the application deployment package to be deployed to AWS
    4. Deploy serverless applications
2. Domain 2: **Security** 26%
    1. Make authenticated calls to AWS services
    2. Implement encryption using AWS services
    3. Implement application authentication, and authorization
3. Domain 3: **Development with AWS Services** 30%
    1. Write code for serverless applications
    2. Translate functional requirements into application design
    3. Implement application design into application code
    4. Write code that interacts with AWS services by using APIs, SDKs, and AWS CLI
4. Domain 4: **Refactoring** 10%
    1. Optimize application to best use AWS services and features
    2. Migrate existing application code to run on AWS
5. Domain 5: **Monitoring and Troubleshooting** 12%
    1. Write code that can be monitored
    2. Perform root cause analysis on faults found in testing or production
    
The percentages are an attempt to _quantify_ the valid knowlege set for a Developer Associate, but they only tell us the portion of the total knowledge set a prospective Developer Associat needs for Deployment. Those numbers tell us nothing about the quantity of data elements.

Exams can give us a much better idea of the _quantity_ of data elements that a person needs to know to understand **Deployment** at the Developer Associate level.

Good morning Mark - my name is Dimitri, and i am with the Cloud & IT infrastructure team! Congrats of your recent AWS certification, and i would like to ask you if you have any resource to recommend as practice tests? i am planning to take the solutions architect in the near future!

I was taking the exams in order to learn AWS. I was using a kind of test-to-learn process, so that turned out to mean that testing turned out to be one of the biggest tools I used to prepare for the exams, too. I found a few free or very cheap practice tests, but the best ones I found are about $13-$20 on Udemy, when they have a sale every few weeks. Sometimes they pop up to $60-$100, but WestMonroe reimburses for them anyway.

Search for exams for the test you're going to take with either of these guys: 

SO you definetely want to take as many practice exams you can fit in. They take two to three hours, and then you have to review all the answers you didn't KNOW, not just guessed right, but KNOW, so that is a time cost you have to calculate into your considerations, but it was the most dense learning, for me.

All those authors and other also have good training courses too, and you will probably want one of those also, to connect the dots and provide better context. They have walk-through labs that you can follow along and some code, and important PDF slides. The slides have condensed graphics on each of the topics which are very helpful. Neal Davis has sets of cheat sheets for each topic.

You want to review the subject matter that you get wrong on the exams before you retake any practice exam. You want to be sure you're not just memorizing ANY questions. You kind of have to self-monitor that, because it will weaken you when the real exam is slightly different and you've only memorized the words or terms or names. Sometimes the exam will describe the process instead of using the name of the solution.

The most comprehensive background material with the best videos and course material, if you have a little more time to study is the courses at https://cantrill.io/. I went back and got the "learn everything" course there. He has multiple repos and code labs and stuff and his explanations are the easiest to understand and deepest. He doesn't have a mobile app, so you have to listen in the browser on your phone if you're at that point.  

Stephane Maarek, above, can be a little hard to understand sometimes because he speaks very fast and is a little sloppy with actually pronouncing the words he's saying. It's not a problem you can't understand, but when listening a lot it can be distracting. Cantrill is SUPER clear.

The Udemy exams are a little tough to review because when you follow a link and then return it doesn't take you back to the question or the test it. It takes you back to the course. That makes it so you don't want to follow a link to the source material. I just make a scraper yesterday so that I can copy the results of the test into a local HTML doc in a private repo and convert it into a Markdown doc with collapsible sections for the answers. Then you can view it on Github as a web page with collapsible sections and follow links in the browser, instead of the Udemy app which can be very annoying.
