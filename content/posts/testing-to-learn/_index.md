Testing shouldn't just finalize learning. It should be integrated from the start of learning.

Learning is hard for everyone. That's why low-overhead learning is profound.

## Low overhead learning is profound

Learning is often uncomfortable. If you're learning something important, that means you're learning somethging important _that you didn't know before_. You should not fee bad about not knowing yesterday what you learned today. That mental hygene will help you keep learning in a positive light, but even in the most positivistic learners they will eventually discover something that they _should have known_ before. Sometimes this is just the result of them accepting uneccessary blame, but other times it is just because learning can be uncomfortably slow.

Fast learning is a superpower, and fast learning requires low-cost learning.
