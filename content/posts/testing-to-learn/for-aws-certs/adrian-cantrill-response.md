## Response

First, thank you for your valid and 100% accurate assessment. Everything you've said provides me with a very valuable correction. I'm seeing my article from another angle now, and it lacks a primary component I intended to include from the beginning. I naively set a word count target and subtly confused that with a measure of completeness.

Second, I found your training late in my learning process and have had to take on some new learning before I can return to that for better coverage.

I meant to correct my article before responding to you. Still, after adjusting the outline while considering your observations, the article's length might double, so it will take a little longer.

Thank you once again for your quick and insightful assessment.
