High-tech has always been admired by humnaist intellectuals for it's vast productivity advantage over the moralists. The moralists have always resented and hated the technologists for this advantage, _but they admired them_ for it too.

For many centuries the Pyramid shape stood over the world and over the minds of the moralists as the tallest-standing man-made structures. They were the tallest every day and they had stood for a longer number of days than all the structures around them. Intellectual moralists could not help but ponder that fact. Then, they attempted to extrapolate from that fact. `"How were the tallest structures in the world built? Well, you can see it in the structure itself. One stone pinnacle is elevated up by a great many subornate stones. The Pyramids were build by slavery.`"
