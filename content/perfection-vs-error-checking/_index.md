What is probably the most destructive error in all of cognition is the idea that there is a perfect world which this world is an imperfect reflection of.

From that theory also comes the idea that "natural intelligence" would be a mystical "insight" into that perfect world from which ours is derived.

Consider, also, the modern counterpoint to this: the success of the "computer revolution", the modern success of information systems, and how they are based first and formost on **error checking**.

The scope of the conflict of these two ideas is almost too broad to fully grasp, and the conflicting ideas are both central to the pursuit of goal-setting and goal-directed action. That means they are central to the pursuit of any pursuit. They are central to moral judgement, norms, law, and what is based on all those things: politics.
