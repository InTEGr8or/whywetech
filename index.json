It makes logic appear as cold and heartless and meaningless. It leaves many people, people who want to have meaningful lives, wanting to escape the mechanistic, predetermined world \u0026ldquo;constrained\u0026rdquo; by lifeless, emotionless reason.\nThis take, of a dichotomy between logic and emotions, is so baseless and counter to the facts of reality that one must wonder how it has survived for so long.\nWomen in Tech The negative connotation of \u0026ldquo;cold logic\u0026rdquo; impacts women\u0026rsquo;s acceptance of tech.\nWhy Women Don't Code - Quillette\nThe Problem With \u0026ldquo;Balancing\u0026rdquo; Logic and Emotion It might be tempting to accept the idea of balancing these two supposed opposites as a solution to the false dichotomy, such as is explained in this video:\nShould You Be Captain Kirk Or Are You Mister Spock?\nThis is a partial solution to a very real problem, but unfortunately it perpetuates the real problem. What\u0026rsquo;s wrong here is that it still accepts that logic and emotion are opposites, which must then be \u0026ldquo;balanced\u0026rdquo;. Why not go all the way and accept that they are not even opposites and that they should, instead, be integrated together into a unified whole, rather than balanced as two opposing forces?ï»¿\n"},{"uri":"http://whywe.tech/","title":"Why We Tech","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\nWhat is the status of technology in our lives?\nHumans have recorded stories involving technology going back to the most ancient writings. We also have extensive collections of human artifacts through which we can a tendency towards technology.\nWhat is the cultural evaluation of technology? Throughout history the tradesman, the tinkerer, and the artificer have been described as trivial actors on the world stage. The characters that populate histories before 1800 have been mostly conquerors and clerics. The rulers had a much larger role when citizens still called themselves \u0026ldquo;subjects\u0026rdquo;. The conquerors and rulers were the men that subjugated all the residents of their countries, and the clerics explained why this was their \u0026ldquo;divine right\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;mandate of heaven\u0026rdquo;. Before the special sciences, clerical scholars were focused on morality and the organization of society.\nTechnical innovators, it is becoming clear now, are not trivial actors on the world stage. Starting with the banks in Italy and \u0026ldquo;manufactories\u0026rdquo; of England, private owners were becoming as wealthy as royalty and, eventually, as heads of state.\nTheir wealth was not the result of conquering and looting the wealth accumulated by others, but by starting to identify the sources of wealth itself, and by producing more of it.\nThat was an entirely different approach than the clerics had always promoted, which were various forms of sharing equity, always favoring the conqueror/rulers who made the clerical way of life one of the three estates of their society.\nThe clerics worked for centuries on mystical solutions to life\u0026rsquo;s problems. The mystical solutions often failed. Miracles are not a method. So the clerics often settled for describing ways to accept \u0026ldquo;one\u0026rsquo;s lot in life\u0026rdquo;.\nFortunately for us, technological innovators did not settle. They produced the steam engine, and left the scholars to describe it and catch up. The \u0026ldquo;electricians\u0026rdquo; played with and demonstrated electrical phenomenon, and left the scholars to catch up. They created manufactories and division of labor, and left the scholars to catch up. They created mediums of exchange and fiduciary media and left the scholars to catch up.\nSlowly these innovations, and their subsequent elucidation by scholars, changed the way we thought, spoke, lived, and self-organized societies more than the scholars and clerics alone were ever able to do.\nThis website is directed at clarifying that history, and uniting the clerical scholars who are focused on morality, with the technical scholars and the technical innovators who are focused on technics, methods, and tacit knowledge of actually completing well-defined tasks and providing solutions to well-defined problems.\n"},{"uri":"http://whywe.tech/anti-tech/why-alien-life-would-be-our-doom/","title":"Why Alien Life Would Be Our Doom","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Here is just another anti-tech screed styled as observation on alien life forms.\n  If anyone doubts that there is an ideological war against tech, here is yet another example.\n  "},{"uri":"http://whywe.tech/other-users/","title":"The Value of Other Users","tags":[],"description":"","content":"I am reading Judea Pearl\u0026rsquo;s fascinating book \u0026ldquo;The Book of Why\u0026rdquo;, about the cognitive liberation going on in science due to the innovation of causal notation.

The prior scientist wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to develop the idea further because it would have required thousands of transistors on a chip, which wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite imaginable at the time.\nThis scenario highlights one of the values of thick markets of technological goods.

They argue the moral cases of society. They discuss the very central issues to humans and to our life in this world, and they use modern technology such as statistics and technical studies to make their case. The technical basis lends them the prestige of science, which has been so obviously successful at producing solutions. Unfortunately, their philosophical sub-basement still contains the cobwebs, carcasses and echoes of their ancient religious catacombs.\nThe philosophical basis of the modern humanitarian clerics has crawled straight out of the swamps of pre-civilized early man, and taken residence in the halls of the academy.\n"}]
