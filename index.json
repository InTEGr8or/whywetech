We also have extensive collections of human artifacts through which we can a tendency towards technology.\nWhat is the cultural evaluation of technology? Throughout history the tradesman, the tinkerer, and the artificer have been described as trivial actors on the world stage. The characters that populate histories before 1800 have been mostly conquerors and clerics. The rulers had a much larger role when citizens still called themselves \u0026ldquo;subjects\u0026rdquo;. The conquerors and rulers were the men that subjugated all the residents of their countries, and the clerics explained why this was their \u0026ldquo;divine right\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;mandate of heaven\u0026rdquo;. Before the special sciences, clerical scholars were focused on morality and the organization of society.\nTechnical innovators, it is becoming clear now, are not trivial actors on the world stage. Starting with the banks in Italy and \u0026ldquo;manufactories\u0026rdquo; of England, private owners were becoming as wealthy as royalty and, eventually, as heads of state.\nTheir wealth was not the result of conquering and looting the wealth accumulated by others, but by starting to identify the sources of wealth itself, and by producing more of it.\nThat was an entirely different approach than the clerics had always promoted, which were various forms of sharing equity, always favoring the conqueror/rulers who made the clerical way of life one of the three estates of their society.\nThe clerics worked for centuries on mystical solutions to life\u0026rsquo;s problems. The mystical solutions often failed. Miracles are not a method. So the clerics often settled for describing ways to accept \u0026ldquo;one\u0026rsquo;s lot in life\u0026rdquo;.\nFortunately for us, technological innovators did not settle. They produced the steam engine, and left the scholars to describe it and catch up. The \u0026ldquo;electricians\u0026rdquo; played with and demonstrated electrical phenomenon, and left the scholars to catch up. They created manufactories and division of labor, and left the scholars to catch up. They created mediums of exchange and fiduciary media and left the scholars to catch up.\nSlowly these innovations, and their subsequent elucidation by scholars, changed the way we thought, spoke, lived, and self-organized societies more than the scholars and clerics alone were ever able to do.\nThis website is directed at clarifying that history, and uniting the clerical scholars who are focused on morality, with the technical scholars and the technical innovators who are focused on technics, methods, and tacit knowledge of actually completing well-defined tasks and providing solutions to well-defined problems.\n"},{"uri":"http://whywe.tech/posts/testing-to-learn/","title":"Testing to learn and deliberate practice","tags":[],"description":"","content":"I scheduled my first AWS Exam for a Friday and had been doing the in-course questions and passing at about 80%. Then, on the Wednesday morning before the scheduled exam I took the BenchPrep official practice exam. I scored 30%. There was an elevation of urgency.\nOver the next several hours I blocked out all thinking about anything else, as much as that\u0026rsquo;s possible. I was able to eleminate all social media and as much interpersonal communications as possible and isolate my brain to a dedicated task, flushing the cache on almost all other concerns and clearing my plate.\nWithin those two and a half days I was able to turn my 30% score on the practice exam, which is significantly easier than the full exam, into an 82% on the official exam.\nOver the next few months I developed my learning process into what I call the \u0026ldquo;test-\u0026gt;learn REPL\u0026rdquo; and passed an additional 5 AWS Certified Exams:\nI learned some strong lessons about laser-focused learning, known as \u0026ldquo;deliberate practice\u0026rdquo;, which I want to record for myself and which I want to share with you in this post.\nNOTE: The first thing I did was to notify everyone I needed to that I would not be responding until after 6 PM Friday. You have to have your mind as clear as possible, and you can\u0026rsquo;t do that if you have something hanging over it. AWS allows rescheduling.\nThe Test-\u0026gt;Learn REPL Rapid learning is like a superpower. Learning a new technology fast means all the subsequent work you do in that technology will be much more productive.\nThis is why testing is closely related to the whole field of technology. Technological improvements are characterized by one significant feature: They can be tested.\nTesting is the fastest way to validate your thinking.\nWhenever we want to know if a person understands a topic we start asking them questions about it. Those are little tests. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t prove they know the whole subject, so if we need higher levels of expertise, we continue to ask questions or we observe them working under real-world simulating test conditions.\nThis is the same process invlolved in learning by \u0026ldquo;experience\u0026rdquo;. Experience has a very broad definition, but in the contect of learning it simply means you have been tested with active business challenges.\nThe AWS Certified exams are an attempt to approximate a specific set of active buiness challenges in order to validate a candidate\u0026rsquo;s pertainent knowlege set.\nAWS Provides these stats regarding AWS Exam Certs:\nIn the same way that the AWS Certified exam is just an approximation of the real-world business challenges a developer may face, the Practice Exams available on Udemy, BenchPrep, and the AWS official practice questions are an approximation of the test questions on the AWS Certified Exam.\nThe self-testing process Try the free tests firsts. AWS provides practice exam questions for each offical exam along with an Exam Guide here: Browse Exams\nThere are other free exams online and very cheap ones in the Android Play Store but those are mostly a waste of time.\nThe best practice exams I\u0026rsquo;ve found are the paid exams on Udemy. They\u0026rsquo;re mostly around $12, but up to $100 off-sale. Get a highly rated one and you should get a fair approximation of the offical exam content domain.\nThe Udemy exams allow you to take them as often as you want. That means you can you can stop if you get 2 out of the first 3 wrong.\n(I am not a salesperson for Udemy. If you know of any other good practice exams please create a PR for this article.)\nIt also means you can start testing before you start learning. I did this for a couple of exams so that I could get a baseline on the knowlege set.\nStop taking example questions if your pass rate is less than 60%. Avoid \u0026ldquo;gaming\u0026rdquo; the question by thinking \u0026ldquo;AWS always favors their newest product\u0026rdquo;. The\u0026rsquo;ve done a decent job of avoiding undue product bias in their answers. You\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use your failed questions to narrow down the target to study your weak areas. Exam review has lots of information about the question! The Udemy practice exam review provides significant context for the exam question. This is the most important part of the Testing-\u0026gt;Learning REPL.\nBudget a few hours after each practice exam to review, drill down in the links, and understand the context of each question you failed. For verbage-based topics you can have the browser\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Read Aloud\u0026rdquo; function read long content to you.\nUdemy practice exams are typically 4 exams of 65 questions so that each exam mimics the AWS Exam. They are timed based on the AWS Exam you are practicing for.\nThat means you can take one exam and study the answers for a few days, and then take another practice exam with another set of questions, so you don\u0026rsquo;t memorize the answer pattern. The questions are also rotated between exam attempts.\nHazzards of Testing-\u0026gt;Learning You will have to monitor your thinking while you\u0026rsquo;re testing to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re not doing any of this:\nYou are ripping yourself off every time you answer a question by pattern: If you say \u0026ldquo;I remember that the question that started this way should have the answer that started that way\u0026rdquo;. Always only ever answer the question after you understand the full context of the question. Never guess on the practice exams. You win nothing by guessing the right answer on a practice exam. You actually rip yourself off and cause yourself to lose one valuable practice exam question every time you guess. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure of the answer you can flag the question. You then will have to be sure to review your flagged questions when you\u0026rsquo;re doing your review process. You can guess on the official exam and you\u0026rsquo;ll lose nothing there because you can\u0026rsquo;t get a list of your failed questions and review them on the official exam.\nResources Testing is not the source of the information you are tested on.\nThe practice exams provide answers about the questions you are tested that you can view after you answer the question, and those answers have content and links to other information resources.\nOrganized informational content can be much more effective and helpful than simply Googling each question or browsing YouTube videos.\nHere are some of he resources I found most usefull and refered to most often:\nFree AWS Support â€“ Knowledge Center Here are some of the most frequent questions and requests that AWS receive from their customers. This is a large set of questions and answers.

That file will sort to the top.\nThen you can create a git repo for that folder and push it to a host like GitHub which will render your markdown notes in a webpage, complete with image links.\n"},{"uri":"http://whywe.tech/pro-logic/","title":"Pro Logic","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Logic is best defined as non-contradictory identification.\n"},{"uri":"http://whywe.tech/pro-logic/static-sites-for-active-documentation/","title":"Static Sites for Active Documentation","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Portability ASCII Markdown Folder tree hierarchy navigation Serverless Micropublishing Independent of server archetecture/tech stack Text Transpilation Ingest process all data sources into ASCII word structures Render ASCII word structures into any display format Word-based concept storage and processing Active Notebooks REPL Interactive Data-Info Programming Learning by doing recursivity "},{"uri":"http://whywe.tech/anti-logic/","title":"Anti-Logic","tags":[],"description":"Exploring the social status of logic.","content":"Anyone using a computer in the 21st century should have at least some cursory respect for logic, but why is logic not a commonly declared ideal like physical health or wisdom?\nThe Problem With Spock While the Spock character from \u0026ldquo;Star Trek\u0026rdquo; is a generally pro-logic character, he perpetuates one very destructive myth about the nature of logic, that it is opposed to and separate from emotion and feeling.\nEmotional Isolation This is so destructive because it sets in stone a non-existent dichotomy between reason and our entire emotional lives.

It leaves many people, people who want to have meaningful lives, wanting to escape the mechanistic, predetermined world \u0026ldquo;constrained\u0026rdquo; by lifeless, emotionless reason.\nThis take, of a dichotomy between logic and emotions, is so baseless and counter to the facts of reality that one must wonder how it has survived for so long.\nWomen in Tech The negative connotation of \u0026ldquo;cold logic\u0026rdquo; impacts women\u0026rsquo;s acceptance of tech.\nWhy Women Don't Code - Quillette\nThe Problem With \u0026ldquo;Balancing\u0026rdquo; Logic and Emotion It might be tempting to accept the idea of balancing these two supposed opposites as a solution to the false dichotomy, such as is explained in this video:\nShould You Be Captain Kirk Or Are You Mister Spock?\nThis is a partial solution to a very real problem, but unfortunately it perpetuates the real problem. What\u0026rsquo;s wrong here is that it still accepts that logic and emotion are opposites, which must then be \u0026ldquo;balanced\u0026rdquo;.
