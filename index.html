We also have extensive collections of human artifacts through which we can a tendency towards technology.</p><p>What is the cultural evaluation of technology? Throughout history the tradesman, the tinkerer, and the artificer have been described as trivial actors on the world stage. The characters that populate histories before 1800 have been mostly conquerors and clerics. The rulers had a much larger role when citizens still called themselves &ldquo;subjects&rdquo;. The conquerors and rulers were the men that subjugated all the residents of their countries, and the clerics explained why this was their &ldquo;divine right&rdquo; or &ldquo;mandate of heaven&rdquo;. Before the special sciences, clerical scholars were focused on morality and the organization of society.</p><p>Technical innovators, it is becoming clear now, are not trivial actors on the world stage. Starting with the banks in Italy and &ldquo;manufactories&rdquo; of England, private owners were becoming as wealthy as royalty and, eventually, as heads of state.</p><p>Their wealth was not the result of conquering and looting the wealth accumulated by others, but by starting to identify the sources of wealth itself, and by producing more of it.</p><p>That was an entirely different approach than the clerics had always promoted, which were various forms of sharing equity, always favoring the conqueror/rulers who made the clerical way of life one of the three estates of their society.</p><p>The clerics worked for centuries on mystical solutions to life&rsquo;s problems. The mystical solutions often failed. Miracles are not a method. So the clerics often settled for describing ways to accept &ldquo;one&rsquo;s lot in life&rdquo;.</p><p>Fortunately for us, technological innovators did not settle. They produced the steam engine, and left the scholars to describe it and catch up. The &ldquo;electricians&rdquo; played with and demonstrated electrical phenomenon, and left the scholars to catch up. They created manufactories and division of labor, and left the scholars to catch up. They created mediums of exchange and fiduciary media and left the scholars to catch up.</p><p>Slowly these innovations, and their subsequent elucidation by scholars, changed the way we thought, spoke, lived, and self-organized societies more than the scholars and clerics alone were ever able to do.</p><p>This website is directed at clarifying that history, and uniting the clerical scholars who are focused on morality, with the technical scholars and the technical innovators who are focused on technics, methods, and tacit knowledge of actually completing well-defined tasks and providing solutions to well-defined problems.</p><div class=panels><div class=main><section class=row><div class=col-md-6><div class=card-body><a href=/perfection-vs-error-checking/ class=article-titles><h4 class=section-title>Perfection vs Error Checking</h4></a><p class=lead><em></em></p><div class=article-summary>What is probably the most destructive error in all of cognition is the idea that there is a perfect world which this world is an imperfect reflection of.
From that theory also comes the idea that &ldquo;natural intelligence&rdquo; would be a mystical &ldquo;insight&rdquo; into that perfect world from which ours is derived.
Consider, also, the modern counterpoint to this: the success of the &ldquo;computer revolution&rdquo;, the modern success of information systems, and how they are based first and formost on error checking.</div></div></div><div class=col-md-6><div class=card-body><a href=/posts/ class=article-titles><h4 class=section-title>Posts</h4></a><p class=lead><em>Lastest content that I haven't yet integrated into the site structure</em></p><div class=article-summary>This is where my latest content is posted, unstructured, ordered by date descending.</div></div></div><div class=col-md-6><div class=card-body><a href=/pro-logic/ class=article-titles><h4 class=section-title>Pro Logic</h4></a><p class=lead><em></em></p><div class=article-summary>Logic is best defined as non-contradictory identification.</div></div></div><div class=col-md-6><div class=card-body><a href=/anti-logic/ class=article-titles><h4 class=section-title>Anti-Logic</h4></a><p class=lead><em>Exploring the social status of logic.</em></p><div class=article-summary>Anyone using a computer in the 21st century should have at least some cursory respect for logic, but why is logic not a commonly declared ideal like physical health or wisdom?
The Problem With Spock While the Spock character from &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; is a generally pro-logic character, he perpetuates one very destructive myth about the nature of logic, that it is opposed to and separate from emotion and feeling.
Emotional Isolation This is so destructive because it sets in stone a non-existent dichotomy between reason and our entire emotional lives.</div></div></div><div class=col-md-6><div class=card-body><a href=/anti-tech/ class=article-titles><h4 class=section-title>Anti-Tech</h4></a><p class=lead><em>Anti-tech forces retard technical progress, and they have been operating for a long time.</em></p><div class=article-summary>There has been a long-term concerted ideological resistance to technical innovation.

This project was not revealed to me by divine inspiration, and my ability to develop it is not a &ldquo;gift&rdquo;. It is a step-wise process and is still in development.
