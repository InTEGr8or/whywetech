The mere creation of a new causal notation in science diagrams and notation syntax has revealed a whole new facet about how our minds and actions integrate with scientific outcomes.</p><p>In it he tells the story of a scientist who had discovered the Bayesian networks the author developed, but 20 years earlier. The prior scientist wasn&rsquo;t able to develop the idea further because it would have required thousands of transistors on a chip, which wasn&rsquo;t quite imaginable at the time.</p><p>This scenario highlights one of the values of thick markets of technological goods. Other people are developing solutions to problems you do not know you have yet. You don&rsquo;t always <del>have</del> to wait until you have the problem and then start working on the solution.</p><footer class=footline></footer><div class=site-footer><div class=copyright>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.</div><ul class=site-footer-items><li class=site-footer-item-about><a href=/about/ title=About>About</a></li><li class=site-footer-item-tags><a href=/tags/ title=Tags>Tags</a></li></ul><div class=powerdby>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></div></div><script src=/js/script.js></script>
